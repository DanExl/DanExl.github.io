We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.

It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.

You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.

Play with the angles. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let's make a happy little mountain now.

We need a shadow side and a highlight side. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Be brave. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.

Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. With practice comes confidence. There are no limits in this world. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.

I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. At home you have unlimited time. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.
